MOCY provides time series of weekly death counts stratified by country, sex, and age along with useful covariates such as person-weeks exposure time, population-weighted weekly temperature, and public holiday indicators.

This repository contains the source files needed to compile the MOCY database. The compiled data is hosted at [osf.io/k84rz](https://osf.io/k84rz/).

## Sources

Weekly death counts by country, year, sex, and age:

- sourced from HMD-STMF [1]

Weekly person-weeks of exposure by country, year, sex, and age:

- calculated from interpolated annual January 1st population estimates sourced from HMD [2]

Weekly public holidays by country and year:

- derived using <https://github.com/nager/Nager.Date>

Weekly population-weighted average temperature by country and year calculated from:

- Global gridded population 2010 [3]
- Daily global gridded temperature [4]
- Global national grid embedded in [3]
